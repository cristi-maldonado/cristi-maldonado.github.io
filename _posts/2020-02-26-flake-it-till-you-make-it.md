I've gone through several years of schooling and yet I don't feel confident in my work. I have shallow theoretical knowledge of AI/ML and Data Science. I think to myself, "Will I be able to accomplish anything swimming in shallow waters?" So, here I am. Taking on this monstrous task of attempting mastery of a very difficult domain. Feel free to join me on this trip. Maybe what you find here will help you along on your learning path. Maybe you would like to share something that may help me along the way. Whatever the reason, I welcome you and thank you for being a part of this. 

My intended plan is to holistically cover 2 AI/ML/Data Science academic papers a week. If during the course of covering a paper, I find that I need to have a better background understanding I may divert and covering some foundational concept. I will try to highlight information that a beginner will find useful. I will also try to provide code examples. 

Now that my intentions have been thrown out into the either. I hope this means I will continue this blog...
